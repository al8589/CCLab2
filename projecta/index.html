    <h1>Ember</h1>

    <p>
        The idea behind Ember was inspired by Calcifer from the Studio Ghibli movie, <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>, who's a little fire spirit that could interact with human characters. While I didn't envision my creature speaking, I wanted it to be able to interact with me, the scientist, through sparking, eating up food particles, shrinking and growing, and following where I wanted to lead it. In this way, it would be a sentient creature. Then, I sought to come up with the backstory, in which I settled on a narrative where I found Ember while my laboratory where we tested radioactive substances was burning down due to an accident, and I caught it to take home to study. In my personal home lab, this is where I discovered Ember was a little (harmless and friendly) mutant fire creature.
